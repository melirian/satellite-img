# Satellite imaginery
This repository is created to exercise on how to obtain, process the data. Most data is Sentinel 2 images obtained **[here](http://devseed.com/sat-ml-training/DeepLearning_CropType_Segmentation#Specific-concepts-that-will-be-covered)**. 
## Libraries
- rasterio
- geopandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- os, glob, functools, fnmatch
- google.colab: drive (since I used to store the images in my Google drive)
You can simply install it using pip install comand if there is no your environment.
